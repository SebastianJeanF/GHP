There needs to be a camera attached near the hand of the robot

The camera feed needs to be sent to a running python program that will run a face detection on it
and subsequently find the coordinates of the face

The coordinates data needs to be continuously sent to an arduino

The arduino uses the coordinate data to rotate the robot arm or enable it
to lower and hit the face
    If the coordinates don't change from call to call, the robot won't move in the x/y directions
